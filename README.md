This is the biggest project I've ever worked on. The first version (which is in a different repository) got me putting 560+ hours in, over the last two years.
With this version I brought a lot of standardization as well as more readable and efficient code.

I'm gonna be using this version of rooster.io to conduct a study on the inner workings, with [docs](http://docs.werkmanrooser.nl) and an [essay](http://hoewerkt.werkmanrooster.nl) (which is written in Dutch).

Thanks for checking out this repository, feel free to browse around the code or use the [docs](http://docs.werkmanrooster.nl) to get to a better understanding of how it all works.
